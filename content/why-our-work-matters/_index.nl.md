corevalues:
  - title: Ethical Integrity
    description: Volunteers must demonstrate a strong commitment to ethical conduct
      in their work. They should prioritise the well-being and safety of
      internet users and respect privacy and legal boundaries while conducting
      vulnerability research.
  - title: Societal Responsibility
    description: Volunteers should be driven by a sense of societal responsibility,
      understanding the importance of their role in making the digital world
      safer. Their motivation should stem from the desire to serve the common
      good, rather than pursuing personal benefits, political objectives, or
      individual interests.
  - title: Collaborative Mindset
    description: "It is essential for volunteers to appreciate the importance of
      collaboration and teamwork. They should be open to engaging with a variety
      of stakeholders, such as vendors, researchers, and reliable partners.
      Their role involves orchestrating vulnerability disclosure and efficiently
      reducing risks. The accomplishment of DIVD’s mission heavily relies on
      effective communication and cooperation. "
  - title: Technical Proficiency
    description: It is crucial for volunteers to have a robust knowledge of
      cybersecurity principles and methods. If they are considering joining one
      of our technical teams, they need to possess the necessary technical
      expertise to effectively detect and scrutinize vulnerabilities in online
      systems. Keeping up-to-date with the latest technologies and threats
      through continuous learning is indispensable.
