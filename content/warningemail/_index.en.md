title: Notification email
opener: We report vulnerabilities to prevent issues
intro: When a vulnerability is found, we open a case and create a fingerprint. A case is a record or file created to document and manage the process of addressing a specific vulnerability. A fingerprint serves as a unique identifier or signature for the vulnerability, aiding in the identification of affected systems. Subsequently, we start scanning to identify vulnerable instances and notify the owners of these systems. This structured approach ensures that vulnerabilities are systematically tracked, managed, and resolved.

    CSIRT: Computer Security Incident Response Team

    The CSIRT is responsible for scanning and disclosing vulnerabilities identified by either DIVD researchers or third parties. Additionally, it alerts individuals about leaked credentials and manages our CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) functions.

    **Only owners of vulnerable instances receive a notification with the host information and mitigation steps.**

  title: A step-by-step guide on what you should do
  description: If you've received an notification (email) from our CSIRT, check whether the email address contains @divd.nl. This could be csirt@divd.nl, divd-case-number@csirt.divd.nl or a name-of-researcher@divd.nl (as some of our researchers prefer to send notifications from their personal DIVD account).
