DIVD aims to make the digital world safer by reporting vulnerabilities we find in digital systems to those who can fix them. While the existence of a vulnerability is not something to celebrate, thanks to the hard work of skilled volunteers working for DIVD, we have been able to notify vulnerable organizations of **at least 1 million** (1.295.494) compromised IP addresses. The vulnerable IPs were part of 143 unique [cases](https://csirt.divd.nl/cases/).

Because of the notifications, organizations become aware of weaknesses and accidental misconfigurations in their systems, allowing them to address these issues **before** cybercriminals can exploit them. This approach helps in preventing cyber attacks and contributes to a safer digital world.

Also a big shoutout to our [partners](https://www.divd.nl/contribute/partners/) and [volunteers](https://www.divd.nl/contribute/volunteers/). We couldn't have done this without them! 

If you would like to contribute to DIVD's mission, your donations are more than welcome. You can also [sign up](https://www.divd.nl/contribute/volunteers/) as a volunteer and offer your time and skills here. 

Make sure to [follow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/divd-nl/?) us on LinkedIn and [X](https://x.com/DIVDnl) (formerly known as Twitter) and take notice of every important update.
