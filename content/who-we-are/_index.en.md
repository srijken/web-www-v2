  title: History
  intro: "This wonderful adventure started with the work of hacker Victor Gevers,
    who was already scanning and notifying the whole world for 20 years.
    Together with Parliamentarian cybermum Astrid Oosenbrug, writer/researcher
    and talk show host Chris van ‘t Hof, he registered Dutch Institute of
    Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) as a foundation on 26 September 2019. After
    the launch CISO/hacker Frank Breedijk and Security Analyst Lennaert
    Oudshoorn joined and started the first case in January 2020: Citrix,
    notifying 546 potential victims in the Netherlands. "

    Citrix, notifying 546 potential victims in the Netherlands. After this first
    media exposure many hackers and partners joined. Together they drew up a
    Code of Conduct to comply with the rules of vulnerability disclosure. In
    that year, 13 more cases followed, notifying 58K potential victims
    worldwide. "

  description: Cybersecurity is an endless race between attackers and defenders.
    This endlessness can work tiring for a lot of people in the industry. What
    makes DIVD amazing is the fact that we are in between these attackers and
    defenders. We attempt to take away attackers' weapons as quickly as possible
    by making people aware of these weapons. That has a lot of impact! I came to
    participate in the perpetual defender's puzzle and stayed for the way we
    assist organizations by spreading puzzle pieces across the entire globe.
