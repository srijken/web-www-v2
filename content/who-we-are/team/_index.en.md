  - title: Research & Development
    description: DIVD has two teams of highly skilled security researchers who
      voluntarily seek out and report vulnerabilities alongside their regular
      jobs. DIVD ensures they adhere to our Code of Conduct while providing a
      buffer against journalists, lawyers, and recruiters. Their research not
      only uncovers security trends and raises awareness but also helps develop
      new methods for vulnerability research and disclosure. Although you may
      never meet our researchers, you can hope they are inspecting your systems
      right now, catching issues before the bad guys do....
